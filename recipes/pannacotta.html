        <h2>Pannacotta Recipe</h2>
        <p>To prepare a classic vanilla panna cotta, begin by blooming 1 envelope of unflavored gelatin in 2 tablespoons of cold water for about 5 to 10 minutes. In a medium saucepan, combine 2 ½ cups of heavy cream, 1 ½ cups of whole milk (or 1/2 cup for a richer texture), and 1/3 cup of sugar. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves and the cream is hot, but do not bring it to a boil. Remove from the heat and stir in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract (or a vanilla bean) and the softened gelatin, whisking until the gelatin is completely dissolved.</p>
        <p>Carefully pour the mixture into six individual ramekins or wine glasses, allowing them to cool to room temperature before covering with plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate the panna cotta for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, until it is firmly set but still has a slight wobble. Once set, serve them directly in the glasses or quickly dip the ramekins in hot water to unmold onto plates. Top with fresh berries, fruit coulis, or caramel sauce for a sophisticated dessert.</p>
