        <h2>Tiramisu Recipe</h2>
        <p>Tiramisu is a classic, no-bake Italian dessert featuring layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers (savoiardi) and a rich, creamy mascarpone mixture. To prepare the filling, egg yolks are traditionally whisked with sugar until pale and thick, then combined with mascarpone cheese; many modern recipes also incorporate whipped cream or whipped egg whites to create a lighter, fluffier texture. The ladyfingers are briefly dipped into cold, strong espresso—sometimes mixed with alcohol like rum or Marsala wine—and arranged in a dish, followed by a layer of the cream mixture, with the process usually repeated twice.
            </p>
            <p>The dessert is finished by dusting the top layer with generous amounts of unsweetened cocoa powder, providing a slight bitterness that perfectly balances the sweet cream. For the best results, the assembled tiramisu must be refrigerated for at least 6 hours, or ideally overnight, allowing the flavors to meld and the ladyfingers to soften. This chilling process also ensures the dessert sets, making it easy to slice into neat, decadent squares.</p>
