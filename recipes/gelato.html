        <h2>Gelato Recipe</h2>
        <p>Authentic gelato is created by making a custard base, which requires heating a mixture of roughly 500ml of whole milk, 250ml of cream, and 150g of sugar in a saucepan until steaming. While the mixture warms, four large egg yolks are beaten in a separate bowl until thick and pale. To ensure a smooth, dense texture, the hot milk is slowly poured into the egg mixture while whisking constantly—a process known as tempering—to avoid scrambling. This combined custard is then returned to the saucepan and cooked over low heat, stirring continuously, until it thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. </p>
        <p>Once the custard thickens, it is removed from the heat, strained through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl, and allowed to cool. For the best results, the base must be thoroughly chilled in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or overnight, to ensure a smooth, velvety consistency. The cold custard is then poured into an ice cream maker and churned for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the mixture is thick, smooth, and has a soft-serve texture. Finally, the gelato is transferred to an airtight container and frozen for another 2 to 4 hours to fully set. It is best served slightly warmer than traditional ice cream for maximum flavor and texture. </p>
